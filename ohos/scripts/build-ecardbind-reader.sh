# hvigor does not compile ohos/entry/src/main/cpp. The module ships a committed
# .so under ohos/entry/libs/arm64-v8a/ instead, so the release image needs no C++
# toolchain — worth 4.5 GB of image and a manual republish step (CLAUDE.md ->
# OHOS-specific gotchas). Run this whenever anything under src/main/cpp changes:
# test/ecard_bind_reader_artifact_test.dart fails until the committed .so carries
# the digest of the source it was built from.
#
# The SDK is a local dependency; override CLD_DIR if it is not where .envrc says.
